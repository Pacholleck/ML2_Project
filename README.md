# ML2 Project
This repository is part of the Machine Learning 2 module at the University of Warsaw and was done by Dustin Pacholleck and Khon Hoang Nguyen.

One part of the project contains a classification problem based on a Hotel cancelation dataset. 
The other part of the project contains a regression problem based on coffee quality prediction.

The project utilizes state-of-the-art methods to achieve the predictions but have to compete agains a classic benchmark model.
